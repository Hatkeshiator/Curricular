# Programming Courses Solutions

This repo will contain all of my C programming work assigned by my college.

./0/ contains the C code for the programming practicals for the
journals, further organized by practical number.

./1/ contains the C code for the first programming assignment to be
submitted on the 15th of September.

./pythonlab/ contains the python scripts for the ongoing python course. 0asses.py contains
the assignment statements

Every .txt file in the C portions is part of the written/theory portions also mandatory.
Theory portions are not mandatory for the python course.

## Starting from Semester III (mid-'24 to '25), if I am in any programming course, this repo will lag significantly behind the progress of the course
